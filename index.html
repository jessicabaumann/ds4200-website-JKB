            <h2>About Jessica</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! My name is <b>Jessica K. Baumann</b>, and I’m a dual-degree candidate at <b>Northeastern University</b> studying <b>Mathematics and Data Science</b> with an expected graduation in December 2027. I’m passionate about using data to solve complex problems and communicate insights that drive meaningful decisions. I currently maintain a 4.0 GPA and am actively involved in campus organizations including <b>Women in Finance</b>, the <b>Association for Women in Mathematics</b>, and the <b>Northeastern University Dance Company</b>, where I serve as <b>Treasurer</b>. Professionally, I’ve gained experience as an <b>Actuarial Co-op</b> at <b>John Hancock</b>, where I worked on the Global Asset Modeling team using GGY AXIS software for year-end testing and automation projects that improved workflow efficiency. I also worked as an <b>Undergraduate Teaching Assistant</b> in Northeastern’s <b>Khoury College of Computer Sciences</b>, helping students understand data science and programming concepts. Starting this December, I will join <b>Wellington Management</b> as a co-op on the <b>Quantitative Trading Research and Analytics</b> team, where I look forward to applying my analytical and mathematical skills to real-world investment strategies. Outside of academics, I enjoy dance choreography, yoga, reading, and travel, which help me balance creativity with technical precision.
