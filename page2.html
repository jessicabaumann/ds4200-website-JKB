            <h2>My Journey and Skills</h2>
            <p>
                I’m <b>Jessica K. Baumann</b>, a dual-degree student at <b>Northeastern University</b> majoring in <b>Mathematics and Data Science</b>. Living and studying in Boston has shaped my academic and professional goals, inspiring me to combine technical problem-solving with creativity and collaboration. I’m passionate about using data analysis, mathematical modeling, and visualization to understand complex systems and drive smarter decisions. My coursework and co-op experience have given me practical insight into applying these skills in real-world contexts. At <b>John Hancock</b>, I worked as an <b>Actuarial Co-op</b>, where I automated testing processes and presented analytical findings to leadership. As an <b>Undergraduate Teaching Assistant</b>, I’ve supported hundreds of students learning data science and programming, which has strengthened my technical understanding and leadership abilities. I’m excited to continue developing as a data-driven professional who values accuracy, innovation, and communication. Outside of academics, I enjoy dance, yoga, and exploring Boston’s neighborhoods — activities that help me stay balanced, creative, and inspired both in and out of the classroom.
